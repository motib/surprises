This book presents surprising results in mathematics that are accessible with a good knowledge of secondary-school mathematics.

Contents:

## The collapsing compass: Euclid proved that any construction that can be done using a fixed compass can performed with a collapsing compass.

## Trisecting an angle: Trisecting an angle is proved to be impossible but it can be done using instruments somewhat more complex that the straightedge and compass.

## Squaring a circle: Adam Kochansy and Ramanujan gave constructions with straightedge and compass for lengths that are very good approximations to \pi.

## The five-color problem: The proof that any graph can be colored with four colors is extremely difficult, but it is relatively simple to prove that it can be done with five or six colors. 

## Guarding a museum: A clever argument based on graph coloring shows that n/3 guards are sufficient to guard any museum with n walls.

## Langford's problem: The problem is to arrange pairs of colored blocks in a row such that there is an arithmetical progression of blocks between each pair.

## Poh-Shen Loh's method of solving quadratic equations based on properties of their roots.

## Induction: This chapter brings little-known inductive proofs in number theory, as well as a proof of McCarthy's 91 function and a presentation of the Josephus problem.

## Origami: Three chapters on the mathematics of origami: the seven axioms, Lill's method and Beloch's fold for finding roots of polynomials and constructions impossible by straightedge and compass: trisecting an angle, squaring a circle and construcing a regular nonagon.

## Mohr and Mascheroni showed that any construction that can be done with straightedge and compass can done with only a compass.

## Steiner showed that any construction that can be done with straightedge and compass can done with only a straightedge provided that a single circle already exists somewhere in the plane.

## Are triangles with the same area and the same perimeter congruent? The answer is no: non-congruent triangles can be constructed with the aid of elliptic functions.

## Gauss's proof that a regular heptadecagon (17-sided polygon) can be constructed with a straightedge and compass.

## Appendix with proofs of trigonometric identities and of lesser-known theorems of geometry.
